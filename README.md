# BlackJack
This project is a better version of the previous one. This version now allows upto 5 players to play the game(increased from 1) + the dealer. This version has exception handeling, better organized than the previous one, and shows the names of players who got a blackjack or got bust(if any) at the end of the game. It displays player names(may be multiple) who scored the highest points and won that round of the game.
